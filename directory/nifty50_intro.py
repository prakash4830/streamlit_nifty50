2. **History of Nifty 50:**
    - The Nifty 50 index was introduced on April 22, 1996, and was developed by India Index Services & Products Ltd. (IISL), 
a subsidiary of NSE. The aim was to create a well-diversified, transparent, and replicable index that could represent 
the top companies in India's economy. Over time, it has become a widely recognized indicator of the Indian stock market 
and is followed by both domestic and international investors.

3. **Structure and Composition:**
    - Number of Constituents: The index consists of 50 large-cap companies across various sectors.

    information technology, financial services, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. This diversification 
    ensures that the index reflects the broad market sentiment rather than being overly reliant on any one sector.
    - Market Capitalization: It is a market-capitalization-weighted index, meaning companies with higher market 
    capitalizations have a more significant influence on the index's overall movement.
    - Rebalancing: The constituents of the Nifty 50 are reviewed and rebalanced semi-annually to ensure that it
    continues to accurately reflect the performance of the top companies in the market.
